*** TODO Add action steps functionality
- [X] List the steps that are relevant to that student.
  + Halfway there. I've got the steps to show the relevant chair that the student is in, but I need to instead get the steps to be based off the ones that the student has DONE.
  + I've got them into the app, but now need to filter steps off that new model
  + Got them filtered but they stopped showing up

- [ ] Need to refactor how the model works
  The model currently is a direct JSONListModel which apparently I'm supposed to create my own model with which the JsonListModel uses as a source instead.

- [ ] Add and remove steps based off checking them off

- [ ] See the steps that are finished as well.
*** STRT Create a StepDetailPage
- [X] Create a basic page
- [ ] Create a basic looking detail view of each step
- [ ] Make it look nice
- [ ] Give the ability to add steps from the list page and jump straight into the detail page
*** STRT Link students and steps
- [X] Make sharepoint links
- [X] Add functionality to get those linked models into the app without crushing it
- [X] Filter the steps by the ones in that other model
- [ ] Get them to show

** STRT Fix the StepDelegate list on Student Detail page
** STRT Build a list for the steps to look good on all places
   - State "TODO"       from              [2020-05-21 Thu 10:42]
